This is my first homework assignment for P8105. This assignment demonstrates the use of git and R Markdown documents.


## Problem 1

The following code chunk creates a dataframe comprised of:

* A random sample of size **10** from a standard Normal distribution
* A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
* A character vector of length **10**
* A factor vector of length **10**, with factors "low", "middle", or "high"

The code chunk then attempts to take the mean of each variable.

```{r problem1_a}
library(tidyverse)

problem1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = ifelse(vec_numeric > 0, TRUE, FALSE),
  vec_character = c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "for", "the", "first", "homework", "problem"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("low", "middle", "high", "low", "low", "middle", "high", "low", "middle", "middle"))
)

mean(problem1_df$vec_numeric)

mean(problem1_df$vec_logical)

mean(problem1_df$vec_character)

mean(problem1_df$vec_factor)
```
